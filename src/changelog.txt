Version 0.7.0:
--------------
[To be released: Never]
[Actually released on: ]
*Created the MainFunctions file. It holds most of the individual functions
    called in the main game function. This makes things a whole lot more neat
    and clean.
*Created the InterfaceClass file. It will hold the nexttextpos rect and the
    selected pointer so that they may be passed to MainFunctions and modified.
*Created the EventFunctions file. It will hold (hopefully) all the individual
    functions related to the different events in the game.
*Removed Menus. They aren't needed yet, and don't seem like they ever will be.
*Removed Buildings. They seemed to add a bit of confusion, especially to the
    code, while not offering much in-game.
*Removed the print commands from the PoisonTimer class.
*Changed how Slow works. Now instead of having a SpeedupTimer that activates
    after a certain amount of time and moves the enemy's speed back up, each
    enemy instance keeps however many SlowTimers they need to, and each's
    duration counts down separately, and the strongest still-active effect is
    chosen each time the enemy moves. SlowTimers use frames for their timing.
    This change allows for an enemy to be, say, slowed for 100 frames at 80% of
    its speed, yet be temporarily slowed for 30 frames at 50% of its speed, and
    it will speed back up on its own once the 30 runs out.
*Simple map has been changed to only two enemy paths. Making it more, well,
    "Simple" lol.
*Started rewriting class functions to be based on frametime instead of amount of
    frames.
*Sender class rewritten to work off frametime.
*Sender objects are removed from senderlist when they are done. (Why didn't I do
    this a long time ago?)
*Towers work off frametime.
*Enemies work off frametime.
*Base costs and ranges are class variables now, instead of being held in
    localdefs.
*The entire numerical system to be somewhat based on DnD 3.5 OGL content.
*Speed system modified.
*Upgrades changed to a single level up, not separate things. Each upgrade can
    increase various stats.

--------------
Version 0.5.7:
--------------
[To be released by: 5 April, 2010]
[Actually released on: 1 April, 2010]
*Wave 11a-20a of Map Simple and Curvy are still not balanced.
*Updating readme.txt.
*Adding better documentation for the mapmaker.
*Added a bit more comments.
*Introduced feature of towers needing 'power' from a link to the base.
*Added 'Node' tower, which can extend powered area.
*'Power' feature removed, too complex at this point.
*Building class created. This is the backend for any structures that aren't
    towers.
*Changed enemy speed from 3 times the speed value in mapproperties to just the
    value in mapproperties. This allows greater and easier customization of
    enemies' speed.
*Fixed bug where map would end if there were only enemies coming from 'c' and/or
    'd' paths.
*Hopefully fixed a bug where the next map would load in a small window, but this
    is unlikely.
*Fixed the next-map-small-screen bug, but have realized that switching maps is
    going to be a whole lot more complex than I had expected. I'm declaring that
    to be a "Not-yet-implemented Feature" for the time being.
*Minor update to mapmaker: Can't save without a base (avoids a common error).
    Also, began adding step by step instructions to the top of the screen.
*Added Poison tower.
*Enemies will have a green health bar when poisoned.

--------------
Version 0.5.6:
--------------
[Actually released on: 14 March, 2010]
*Fixed a bug in the map switching / game ending code, which would allow someone
    to "win" by just clicking "Next Wave".
*Fixed a common bug where a slow tower would slow down an already slowed enemy,
    then the enemy would "pop" back to its original speed.
*Added a map selecting menu. When starting the game, now, a very simple
    selection menu will come up first. The only playable map at this point is
    Map '1'.
*Added an optional description for map files. Simply put a 'description.txt'
    file in your map's folder to see it come up in map selection.
*Added support for map names other than numbers (i.e. Map '1' is now named
    'Simple').
*MapMaker created!!! Run this separately from the game itself from mapmaker.py.
*Added a Textbox class, taken primarily from DrakeMagi in the thread:
    http://www.python-forum.org/pythonforum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=12895
    Easily the best implementation I've seen.
*Wrote Map Maker Guide in the readme.txt.
*Corrected a bug where enemies would leave the screen and be 'removed', but
    their .move() function would still run, causing a crash.

--------------
Version 0.5.5:
--------------
*Update graphics from:
    http://lostgarden.com/2005/03/game-post-mortem-hard-vacuum.html
    By the way "Danc" thanks for releasing the game art!
*Added the final two paths for the first map. Still not sure if this is the
    direction I want to take the game, but it's making it a little more
    interesting already. Please note, though, that the game is YET AGAIN
    unbalanced, and incredibly hard to beat thus far.
*Balanced out an odd skip in enemy stats. I'll look more at these soon.
*Basic tower is green, slow is blue now...
*Added the Cannon tower back!
*Updated the way towers generate their "buttons" to be more versatile... which
    leaves the door open to a surprise tower I hope to get up and running soon!!
*Made enemy movement much more fluid! No more "snapping" to corners.
*All enemy actions contained in Enemy.taketurn() now.
*Separate moneystolen from enemy.cost.
*Enemy.die() added to simplify all the different Tower.target()'s there now are.
*Corrected some bugs when approaching the last wave.
*Worked on rebalancing waves of enemies. 1-10 are done, 11-20 ARE NOT BALANCED!

--------------
Version 0.5.4:
--------------
*Changed HP back to losing one everytime an enemy leaves the screen. You now
    start with 20 HP, and gain 0.25 HP per turn.
*Has a "Next Wave" button. Does exactly what you think it does.
*Implemented the 'slow' ability for towers. It's pretty awesome :D
*Changed the 'range' price. Its now 20, plus 20 for each range upgrade.
*Added 'super slow' ability for towers. 'slow' brings enemies to 75% of their
    speed for 1.25 seconds; while 'super slow' brings enemies to 50% of their
    speed for 2 seconds.
*New support for multiple enemy paths in a map.
*Pausing has been removed. There are no timers anymore, just hit "Next Wave"
    whenever you want a new wave to come and take as much time between as you'd
    like!
*Can have waves where the enemies come from different paths simultaneously.
*Tower is now a base class for all towers, each of which will be a different
    class.
*Testing of selected is now based on __class__ object instead of __name__ for
    Icon and Menu, and is based on containing Tower in __bases__ for Tower. This
    is more accurate, better code, and will lead to better performance and
    adaptability in the future.
*Icon class now holds a type and the type's towerstats.
*towerstats has become Basictowerstats, and Slowtowerstats has been created.
*SlowTower class created.
*Trimmed down the project folder. I hadn't realized how much extra, useless crap
    there was just lingering in it.
*Towers now generate their upgrade/sell buttons. This will make it easier to add
    new upgrades for other towers.
*Slow towers can now upgrade the 'amount of slow' applied to enemies, and how
    long it lasts.
*Enemies' move modified for accuracy (can now handle float movement), and speed
    coefficients made equal (they move the same distance whether vertical or
    horizontal).

--------------
Version 0.5.3:
--------------
*Ability rects/blits code space optimized.
*Sender class created. These are the objects that control the 'waves' in the
    game. Now, if the game is not paused, you can press Space and the next wave
    will begin while any other will still be going.

--------------
Version 0.5.2:
--------------
*Removed Enemy health options from Options.txt because they weren't used.
*Tried to balance out towers more.
*Increased money gained from enemy kills by 1 credit per enemy.
*Health is now gained: (waveNumberCompleted * player.hpt), where hpt is usually
    one, until abilities are implemented.
*Began commenting some more.
*Towers cannot be placed in the path!
*Tower upgrade buttons are now in the lower right hand corner.
*Player abilities are implemented! Regen gives you extra health each
    wave you defeat; while Interest gives you a boost to your interest rate.
*There is now a 'base' in the middle. Enemies will head toward the base, steal
    credits from you, then head back toward to entrance. If an enemy steals
    credits and you kill it before it gets to the entrance, you will recover
    the stolen credits. This gives you two chances to kill the enemy before it
    hurts you.

--------------
Version 0.5.1:
--------------
*Removed all in-source comments other than those at the top and bottom of the
    main code file. Any comments from now on can be considered up-to-date.
*Menu support updated for callback functions. Menu constructor now takes a list
    of tuples in this format: (String,Callback).
*Menu moving changed to work with right- or middle-button.
*Enemycounter increased to 7, to make the game easier.
*In code: Selected and Towerselected have been merged into Selected.
*In code: Selected and Menuselected have been merged into Selected.
*Towers' Attack, Range, and Speed are upgraded separately now.
*Towers will stay selected if upgrading, but de-select if selling or clicking
    elsewhere.
*Towers' Attack, Range, and Speed have independant costs, based on stats gained.
*HOPEFULLY.... more balanced....
*Enemies that make it through restart at the beginning, so you're still able to
    get money from them.

--------------
Version 0.5.0:
--------------
*Added Enemy image rotations as per Gabriel Baptistussi.
*Enemy images/rotations in pre-generated,pre-loaded array for quickness.
*Added print notifications during loading.
*Added preliminary Menu support/framework. Menus are transparent until clicked 
    on. You can drag them around the screen as well.
*Added preliminary Ability support/framework. Acquiring abilities not yet
    implemented, however some abilities are working by way of keyinput.
*Downtime and startup have been integrated into the main play loop. As a result,
    during this time play is simply 'paused'. Seems to work much better, and be
    more efficient.
*genBackground MUCH more optimized. Play now starts almost instantly, instead of
    15-ish second wait.
*Only one tower type now. Will implement tower upgrading 'into' other types
    (i.e. all towers start as 'basic', but you will be able to upgrade it to
    'fire' or 'slow').
*All tower upgrades are 50 credits. No max level. This is UN-BALANCED!
*Enemy stats are all read from mapproperties.txt files in the map folder.
*Enemies all have the 'none' trait. Changed this a while ago to counteract the
    massive randomness in enemy traits. Enemy traits are still coded (I believe)
    they just aren't accessed at all.
*Nope, enemy traits have been removed because all former traits could be given
    by editing stats in mapproperties.txt.

Disclaimer: The comments is any source file may or may not be accurate! They
    have not been updated in quite a few version. I plan on working on them
    quite soon.

-*-*Lots more. I've been tinkering with this off and on for a while and stopped
    logging changes.

--------------
Version 0.3.6:
--------------
*Raised armor value.
*Added "super armor" trait.
*New folders, files sorted into them.

--------------
Version 0.3.5:
--------------
*Slowed enemies down.
*Slow tower now slows to half the start speed.
*All upgrade levels are now 2/3 of the original cost.
*There's now 5 frames between the release of each enemy.
*Increased default enemy health.
*Slow tower weakened.
*New enemy image. (Actually tried this time. Though it borrows heavily from
    other TDs).
*Corrected a bug where the 'sell price' wasn't showing in downtime or startup.
*'Sell price' now still shows when the tower is fully upgraded.
*Now, when enemies reach the end of the path, the health they have left over is
    deducted from the player's health. In light of this, default player health
    is now 150. This value may need balancing.
*Player health is now an option in options.txt.
*Can now exit the game from downtime and startup.
*Player health is recovered 2 health per wave.
*Wave number and enemy type for the next wave is now displayed in downtime.
*Armor implemented.

--------------
Version 0.3.4:
--------------
*Explosions.
*New enemy image. Not the best.... but it's better than a blue square :)
*Options are now in options.txt. True has to be 1 and False is 0.

--------------
Version 0.3.3:
--------------
*Now you can't place a tower touching another tower.
*Has the option of drawing lines to the enemies when a tower hits them. You can
    turn them off by changing targetlines to 0 in localdefs.py.
*There's a pause between waves. You can adjust the length by changing wavedowntime
    in localdefs.py.
*Can change enemy health boundries: In localdefs.py, lowerhealthmultiplier and
    higherhealthmultiplier are the lowest value and highest value, respectively,
    that can be multiplied to the wave number to generate the enemies' health.
    For example: Default is 7 and 8, so for wave 10, the lowest enemy health could
        be 70 and the highest it could be is 80. For wave 25 they would be 175
        and 200, respectively.

--------------
Version 0.3.2:
--------------
*New tower: slow.
*Tower rebalance.
*Better support for multiple maps/beggining support for progressing levels.
*Basic timer class LocalTimer and SpeedUpTimer for slow towers, both in localdefs.
*Can sell towers now! Just right- or middle-click on a selected tower.

--------------
Version 0.3.1:
--------------
*F key now changes to Fullscreen mode.
*W key now changes to Windowed mode. (default)
*Single script now split into multiple files.

--------------
Version 0.3.0:
--------------
*Expensive enemies now give you only 1.25 times the credits.
*Cheap-O enemies now give you .75 times the credits, and have a tenth less life,
    but are faster as well.
*Rebalancing of towers, at least until the higher levels (basic and fire towers
    end up being useless around wave 60 or so).
*Each tower type upgrades differently now.
*Added cannon tower, which has splash damage.
*Icons at the bottom now tell the type and the price when mousing over.
*You now have 30 seconds before the start to place and upgrade towers. You can
    press Space to skip remaining time once you are done.
*Enemy type is now displayed at the bottom. This is the CURRENT type.
*Twice the chance of an enemy group have no trait ('none').
*Cheap-O and High HP enemies now have a normal health bar, i.e. High HP enemies
    had a health bar 1.5 times longer than others and Cheap-O enemies had empty
    space between the red and the end of the black.
*Changed images for basic and cannon towers.

--------------
Version 0.2.6:
--------------
*Towers now have 4 levels.
*Enemies have a chance to have "traits":
    -None: Basic enemy.
    -High HP: Half again it's usual HP
    -High Speed: Speed factor is increased by one
    -Expensive: 1.5 credits per enemy
    -Cheap-o: Only .5 credits per enemy
*Redone graphics for 800x600 res. (Saves a ton of time)
*Bullets have been removed for the time being. The class is still there, but is
    not implemented.
*If a tower has no enemies in range, it will keep its "ready to fire" state until
    there is one. (Had problems with enemies passing through Sniper's range)
*There is now a "movefile". This specifies what points enemies will head to.
*Redone movefile.

--------------
Version 0.2.4:
--------------
*There's a path now!
*Also, now when you're holding a tower, you can click the white bar to de-select it.

--------------
Version 0.2.3:
--------------
*Runs in 800x600 mode now. "Squares" are mostly gone! Unfortunately, right after
    I did that, I figured out how to find the enemy's path and use the desertpath
    image for it... using squares. I've decided NOT to go that route as I am very
    much trying to stay away from squares.
*Movelist is now simplified, instead of pixels it's essentially the row or column.
    I transferred this over from a temporary design using the co-ords in movelist
    as indices for the gamesquares array. Actually works quite well, if I do say
    so myself :)
*Most distances/sizes are now in terms of squsize, so readjusting for various
    resolutions should be a whole lot easier next time.
*A few commenting type-o's.

--------------
Version 0.2.2:
--------------
*Made screen sizing work, though not the greatest solution. I will continue
    to search for the best possible way to do this. Unfortunately, in implementing
    this, I have pushed farther into "gamesquare" territory, i.e. basing it around
    adjacent squares in the game area, instead of individual pixels. Menu coming soon.

--------------
Version 0.2.1:
--------------
*First public release version.
